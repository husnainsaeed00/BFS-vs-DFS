# BFS-vs-DFS
Breadth first is just simple it uses queue to track the nodes 

But in depth first searh i have used two methods one recursive wchich uses built in call Stack wchich has only capacity of 1000 memory units in python
and its very slwo 

in second method i used iterative approach which uses Stack data type it is little bit faster.
